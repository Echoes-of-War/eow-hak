Notes on Usage _____________________
Place this hak in your HAK directory and then under Module Properties from the Edit menu, select the hak on the Advanced tab. The new tiles will appear under the city tileset.

Note to HAK Distributors ____________
If you wish to include this in your combined "mega" hak for other than a world or module-specific distribution, we ask that you also include this readme in your distribution so that modelers get full credit for their work. The excuse "I forgot where I got that" just doesn't cut it.
