Elven Treetop City

I created most of the non-Bioware content in this tileset.
Other elements come from the following sources, for which I am extremely grateful: Canopied Forest by DLA; Suspended City by kAyZ & Botumys; Rocky Mountains by Bloodmonkey; Rocky Mountains by Lord Rosenkrantz; window texture inspired by an elven stained glass window by Flinding (councilofelrond.com).  Thank you all!  If I used elements from your work and shamefully forgot, I apologise; please notify me if you wish to be credited and I'll make sure to add your name.  :)
